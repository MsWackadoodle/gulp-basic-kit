### Description

I did upload this template because I've gotten tired of all that tedious routine and its nice to have a template ready to start. So basically this is for html coders and it hasnt fancy JS plugins and all that stuff yet. 

There are .keepgit files in some folders -- I wanted to keep the structure I'm comfortable with and gulp.tasks use these folders as srcs or dests so it makes more sense when looking at.

In conclusion you might just ignore commentary lines

### Tools

* Sass   
* Handlebars

### Features

All the basics:
 
 IMGs:

 	* Optimization

 CSS:
	
	* SCSS compilation
 	* Autoprefixing
 	* Src map
 	* Mergin multiply files into one

 JS:
	
	* Compressing
	* Merging

 Also there is sort of the catcher in the field of errors -- gulp.plumber;

+++ json and lr tasks're coming up 
NOTE: image optimizer work just once as you start gulp
	  I didnt get him to look for new files in directory
	  YET 

### How to get this working

1. check if node.js is installed
2. conduct an installation if necessary
3. clone this repo && get there 
4. run in your console
	npm install 
   --it'll download the hell of the node modules
5. run 
	gulp

Thats all though you may want to change gulp tasks as you like them
Im not entirely sure if this's gonna help somebody since I thought we do all prefer to personalize and stuff.
But if you somehow reading this and find the basic kit helping I'd be glad.
